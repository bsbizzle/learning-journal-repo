# Notes on Operators and Loops

- Comparison operators: you can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be...the result will be a boolean true or false

- Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator

- Loops check a condition...if it returns true a code block will run...will keep running code block till returns false

- Loop types: for, while, do while
