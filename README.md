A journal to record my progression

## Growth Mindset

>To hold the axiom in my mind that _it's okay_ to feel like you don't know enough since we can't know everything. Just keep going!

### Reminders

1. Be malleable
2. Don't let frustration get you down!
3. Step back and look what you've done when "stuck"
