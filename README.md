A journal to record my progression

## Growth Mindset

>To hold the axiom in my mind that _it's okay_ to feel like you don't know enough since we can't know everything. Just keep going! **EVERYONE** is learning all the time.

### Reminders

- Be malleable
- Don't let frustration get you down! :confounded:
- Step back and look at what you've done when "stuck" 
  - Ask for help when work stoppage lasts longer than 15 minutes
