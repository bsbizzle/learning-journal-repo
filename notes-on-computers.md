# How Computers Work

- four different parts of computer: input, output, cpu, memory
- software controls hardware
- computers are machines for thinking work (as opposed to manual)
- computer work flow: input, storage, processing, output
- started out as big calculators then moved on to manipulating robots, programming virtual reality, etc.
- ones and zeroes play a big role with how computers work on the INSIDE
- wires and circuits carry all the information on a computer
- a bit is the smallest information a computer can store
- with more bits you can represent more complex information
- the binary system (zeroes and ones) is the basis for everything you see in a computer screen
- circuits conduct electricity (i.e. information) close to the speed of light so lots of information moves through computer circuits
- today's coding language incorporates all characters you can type that get converted into ones and zeroes when entered in the computer
- operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of the computer
