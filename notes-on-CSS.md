- The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element
- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.

# Color in CSS
- Three ways to specify color: RGB values, hex codes and color names
- Contrast is very important in figuring out how to best convey the website to a viewer
