# Javascript Notes

-HTML adds content, CSS enhances the HTML's appearance, Javascript alters how the page behaves and adds interactivity
-The above is called "progressive enhancement"
-Javascript is written in plain text like HTML
-Use <script> HTML element to tell the browser is is coming across a script (using Javascript)
